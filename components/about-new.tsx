          <p>
            I'm a full-stack developer passionate about creating intuitive, performant digital experiences. My journey
            in IT spans React frontend development, Java backend architecture, and enterprise automation.
          </p>
          <p>
            With 5 years of professional experience, I've contributed to projects ranging from e-commerce platforms to
            complex microservices architectures. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and understanding the
            business problems I'm solving.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, I'm exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and continuously
            improving my craft.
